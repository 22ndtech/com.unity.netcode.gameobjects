# Migrate from MLAPI

Recently, we changed our product name, package name, assembly definition names and namespaces.

Starting by this release, our product is now officially called as "Netcode for GameObjects" going forward.

## Target Audience

We already released an experimental package back in March 2021 under the name of "MLAPI Networking Library" (`com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi`).

This document is specifically targeting developers using MLAPI experimental package and will be useful when developers are migrating their existing codebases.
